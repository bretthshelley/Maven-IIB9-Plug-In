<a name="Introduction"></a>Introduction to the IBM IIB version 9 Maven Build Lifecycle</h2>
The IIB9 Maven Plug-In is a significantly rework of the IIB-Maven-Plug-In originally developed by the Swiss SBB.  Its code is derived from the original 
project Snapshot dated to October 2015 and found at <a href="https://github.com/SchweizerischeBundesbahnen/iib-maven-plugin">https://github.com/SchweizerischeBundesbahnen/iib-maven-plugin</a>.  
The rework includes the best pieces of the original work as well as new pieces that make the IIB9 build experience more closely match what developers and architects 
expect of a maven build life-cycle.  The IIB9 Maven Plugin has been updated to support IBM's IIB Version 10 and to provide much better Linux support.  The Version 10 documentation can be found at <a href="http://vadosity.com/maven/">http://vadosity.com/maven/</a>
